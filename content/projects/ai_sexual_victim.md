It is very difficult for sexual crime victims to be successful at legal process due to the lack of resources. Thus, a system is needed to support them with a reliable information and outline the process they will undergo. The problem is that sexual crimes do not belong to a single class, but each type of damage requires different approach and aftercare. Here does AI play an important role.
