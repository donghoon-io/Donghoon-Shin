**Behavioral Intervention Technology (BIT)** employs a broad range of technologies including computers, mobile phones, and sensors to promote users' healthy behavior. There have been efforts to establish a design framework for BIT. However, those efforts revealed critical limitations; Some frameworks often based on individual clinical outcomes or others are purely theoretical models.
In this study, we aim to build a practical BIT framework that overcomes the limitations of prior frameworks. For framework development, we went through 5 phases including desk research, 2 workshops, field study, and final framework development. Acceptability was our major focus when building a framework and computer vision syndrome was used as our test case. Our contribution includes the following: (1) We propose a practical BIT framework by linking the theoretical framework with practical design issues. (2) We detailed the process of framework building which can be applied to different purposes.
